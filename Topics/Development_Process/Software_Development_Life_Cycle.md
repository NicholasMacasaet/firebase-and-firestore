# Introduction to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
### What is SDLC?

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software. The purpose of this process is to provide a structured manner in which we can develop software in order to minimize project risks through forward planning. 

### Why SDLC?
By having a structured approach to building software, we are more capable in ensuring that development process runs smoothly. It becomes easier to split up tasks between teams, goals are more defined and efficiency is usually acheived. It is also the case that planning out the development process allows for clarity between all concerned parties. Whether it is the customer the software is being built for, or the team which is building the software, all parties involved can better understand how development is proceeding. As a result, it saves costs in communication, extensions to the software, and through the design itself, since these processes are usually time consuming if done without planning. 

The stages of this process are as follows:


### Stages

- Plan
- Design
- Implement
- Test
- Deploy
- Maintain

### The Planning Stage
In this stage, we plan according to our resources. Costs, timeline, expected number of users, scheduling, and allocation of team members are all factors which we consider in this stage.

### The Design Stage
In this stage, we design the code structure itself. What frameworks we will be using, what architecture, what services, and the methods by which teams will communicate.

### The Implementing Stage
This is just the coding stage. When we actually begin to code the work after having laid out the design of the project.

### The Testing Stage
This is where the testing of the code takes place. While its usually done during the Implement/Develop Stage, it is considered its own due to the fact that many features can usually only be tested once most features are completed.

### The Deployment Stage
This is when we deploy the software for users to use. The deployed software is called production. Usually there is a seperate copy of the software which is worked on for the purpose of updating production with new features and removed bugs. This is called the "build enviornment". 

### The Maintainence Stage
Now, the development of the original software is done. The maintenance stage is post-production, where we focus on removing existing bugs, adding features, improving security and overall user experience by working on the build enviornment and deploying to production when any substantial changes/updates are made.


### Conclusion
By following this overall process, once can ensure that they are cleanly producing their software. Different sources may provide different "stages", but in terms of ordering of tasks and the overall life cycle, they all refer to the same steps of production. This is ultimately an overview of the processes, one can go into more detail with different designs of the process. There are many different models which one can follow according to their specific conditions and development process/expectation. Examples include the waterfall model, the agile model, the big bang model, so on and so forth, each of which have their own advantages and disadvantages.
