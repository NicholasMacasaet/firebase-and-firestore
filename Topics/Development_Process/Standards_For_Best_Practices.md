### What Is a Standard?

According to the Standards Council of Canada (SCC), a standard is defined "as a document, established by consensus and approved by a recognized body, that provides for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree or order in a given context."

### [Why Are Standards Important?](#why-are-standards-important-1)

Broadly, standards play an important role for ensuring consistency, safety, and quality. They serve as guiding principles for excellence. In the world of technology, such as software engineering, they act as a benchmark for developers to create high-quality, maintainable code that meets industry standards and best practices.

In addition, following standards promotes compatibility between different software components and systems, facilitating seamless integration and communication. This reduces development time, costs, and enhances the overall reliability and scalability of software solutions. This ensures that software systems meet industry-specific requirements and standards for safety, security, and data protection.

#### Example of a Data Governance Standard

In addition to standards about AI, there are many standards about Data Governance that could be relevant for CSC301 students and their partner projects. One such standard is DGSIâ€™s [CAN/CIOSC 100-4](https://dgc-cgn.org/standards/find-a-standard/standards-in-data-governance/remote-access-infrastructure/): Scalable Remote Access Infrastructure.

This standard addresses the challenges of remote work infrastructure, emphasizing scalability and cybersecurity. It provides requirements for organizations to smoothly adjust IT operations to meet the demands of remote work while maintaining security. The guidelines focus on general practices rather than specific tools. By extending the principles outlined in previous standards (CAN/CIOSC 100-1 and CAN/CIOSC 100-2), it aims to ensure flexibility and security in rapidly changing work environments.

This standard is relevant for remote workers, such as CSC301 students, as remote workers often use personal or employer-provided laptops connecting through VPNs and home WiFi, which may pose cybersecurity risks. This standard offers a comprehensive framework to address these concerns effectively.

DGSI offers all their standards for free download on their website, making them easily accessible to all. Similarly, CAN/CIOSC 100-4 is freely available and can be adopted and applied by aspiring software engineers.
