## Brief Introduction to CMake

This article will help readers understand what `CMakeLists.txt` is, why it is used, and provide instructions on how to create a `CMakeLists.txt`. Before getting started, it is important to understand what CMake is. Note that the reader is presumed to have the very basic knowledge of C++, Make, and MakeFile.

Unlike Make, which is a build system that drives the compiler and other build tools to build your code, CMake (or Cross-platform Make) is a "generator" of build systems that can be used for general purpose builds. It is much more high-level such that it can generate a low-level build script in Ninja or Make or many other build systems that you can run with.

The key feature of CMake is that it supports the cross-platform discovery of system libraries, and automatic discovery and configuration of the toolchain, which is much easier to use than Make.

To install CMake, check their [document](https://cmake.org/download/) on how to download and install on Unix/Linux or Windows.


## What is CMakeLists.txt?

When CMake processes a project, the entry point is a source file called `CMakeLists.txt` in the top level of the source directory.

`CMakeLists.txt` is the CMake configuration file, which contains a set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets (executable, library, or both) that will be used to build the program. It determines everything for the building process, from which source files to compile, to which options to choose for the libraries and present to the users.

Here is a simple example of what it looks like:
```CMake
# CMakeLists.txt

# The minimum version of CMake required
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

# Project name
project(MyProject)

# Add main.cpp file of the project root directory as a source file
set(SOURCE_FILES main.cpp)

# Add executable targets
add_executable(MyExecutable ${SOURCE_FILES})

```

## Creating CMakeLists.txt

### CMake Language
`CMakeLists.txt` is written in [CMake Language](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#manual:cmake-language(7)), which consists of comments, [commands](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-commands.7.html#manual:cmake-commands(7)), and [variables](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-variables.7.html#manual:cmake-variables(7)). 

* **Comments** start with `#`
  ```CMake
  # This is a comment
  ```
* **Commands** start with command names and a list of whitespace-separated arguments (case-sensitive).
  ```CMake
  find_package(LIBIGL REQUIRED QUIET)
  ```
* **Variables** are case-sensitive with only alphanumeric characters and underscores. 

  A number of useful variables are automatically defined by CMake (e.g `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`, `PROJECT_NAME`). 

  Use the *set* command to set variable names, and *${variable_name}* to reference a varible in command arguments. 
  ```CMake
  set(Foo a b c)    # Value of Foo is "a;b;c"

  command(${Foo})   # Foo is replaced by a;b;c 
                    # and expands to 3 arguments
  ```

CMake also provides basic **control flow** statements - conditional statements, looping constructs, and procedure definitions. Here are the examples:

* **Conditional statements (e.g [if](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/if.html#command:if))**
    ```CMake
    if(<condition>)
        <commands>
    elseif(<condition>)     # optional block, can be repeated
        <commands>
    else()                  # optional block
        <commands>
    endif()
    ```
* **Looping constructs (e.g [foreach](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/foreach.html#command:foreach), [while](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/while.html#command:while))**
    ```CMake
    foreach(<variable>                           # similar to `for <variable> in <items>` in python.
            <items>)                             # list of items that are separated by semicolon or whitespace
        command(${variable} <arguments>)         # ${variable} - current value from the list
    endforeach()

    while(<condition>)
        <commands>
    endwhile()
    ```
* **Procedure definitions (e.g [function](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/function.html#command:function), [macro](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/macro.html#command:macro))**
    ```CMake
    function(<function_name> <parameters>)
        <commands>
    endfunction()

    macro(<macro_name> <parameters>)
        <commands>
    endmacro()
    ```

### Key Components and Concepts

A `CMakeLists.txt` typically consists of the following elements:

 * **cmake_minimum_required**

    CMake version check: the minimum version of CMake that should be used to process the project.

    ```CMake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
    ```

    You can specify a range of versions (as a general rule, set the highest version you've tested with):
    ```CMake
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15...3.25)
    ```
 * **project**

    Create project with the name of the project that is given to the cmake command.

    ```CMake
    project(MyProject)
    ```

    Projects can have versions, descriptions and languages specified.
    ```CMake
    project(MyProject
        VERSION
            1.0
        DESCRIPTION
            "A project"
        LANGUAGES
            CXX
    )
    ```

* **Set a source file**
  
    ```CMake
    # Add main.cpp file of the project root directory as a source file
    set(SOURCE_FILES main.cpp)
    ```

 * **add_executable** 
  
    ```CMake
    add_executable(MyExecutable ${SOURCE_FILES})
    ```

    Add executable target named `MyExecutable` with source files listed in the `SOURCE_FILES` variable

#### Other components
* **Variables and Options** can be set in `CMakeLists.txt` to control various aspects of the building process.
    ```CMake
    set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)              # enables the c++14 standards
    option(BUILD_TESTS "Build tests" ON)    # build options - whether to build tests
    ```

* **Include your directories and headerfiles**
    ```CMake
    # Adds directories to the compiler's include path.
    include_directories("${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/")
    ```

* **Include your source files**
    Suppose this is your project structure:
    ```
    project_root/
    |-- CMakeLists.txt
    |-- src/
    |   |-- file1.cpp
    |   |-- file2.cpp
    |   |-- ...
    |-- other_files/
    |   |-- ...
    |-- main.cpp

    ``` 
    You can add the source files in the `src` directory by:
    ```CMake
    file(GLOB SRC_FILES "*.cpp")

    # Create a library or executable target using the source files
    add_library(my_library ${SRC_FILES})
    target_link_libraries(MyExecutable my_library)
    ```


* **External Libraries** can be located using `find_package`
    ```CMake
    # Appends the "cmake" directory to the module path
    # CMake modules are used to find and configure external libraries.
    set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH 
        ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} 
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake)

    find_package(PACKAGE_NAME)              # Locate the package with PACKAGE_NAME
                            
    if(PACKAGE_NAME_FOUND)                  # PACKAGE_NAME_FOUND is automatically generated by find_package()
        target_link_libraries (
            MyExecutable <libaries>         # Links against the libraries within the package.
        )
    endif()
    ```

    The if-condition can be omitted if you specify the "REQUIRED":

    ```CMake
    find_package(PACKAGE_NAME REQUIRED) 
    ```

## Other Notes

 * Within any of the supported generators (Visual Studio, etc.), there are rules that will automatically invoke CMake to update the generated files, including MakeFiles or project files, whenever you edit a `CMakeLists.txt` file and rebuild.

* There are many more CMake variables and commands that are useful in building a `CMakelists.txt`. Here is a [cheatsheet](https://cppcheatsheet.com/notes/cmake_basic.html) that consists of most of the popular variables/commands.
