# How to register a domain name

## What are domains?

Websites are reached over the internet using IP addresses, however IP addresses are not very convenient for users as they are hard to remember. Domains are names that are assigned to IP addresses for ease of access. For example instead of accesing a website by an IP of 192.158.1.38 you can access it by domainname.com.

## How do I register a domain for my website?

In order to attach a domain do your webserver you will need to purchase a domain from a Domain Name Registar such as GoDaddy or Namecheap. Prices will vary based on how popular the domain name is. After you have purchased the domain you then have to connect it to the server hosting your website. Most Domain Registars will have a built in system for connecting domain names to servers that you will have to use to connect the two together. After which you can then use your new domain name to connect to your server. This happens independently of the server. Your server doesn't need to know about your new domain name as the domain is only used is the browser to translate to your IP address. It doesn't affect your server. 

## How does an IP address get mapped to a domain name?

Mapping an IP address involves using the Domain Name System (DNS), which can be thought of as the phone book of the internet. When a user enters a domain name into the browser the DNS turns this domain name into the IP address for the desired website. After registering a domain most Domain Name Registars will have a system for adding your domain and endpoint into their DNS.
