# Introduction to Saturn

Saturn https://github.com/1whatleytay/saturn is a MIPS interpreter and assembler developed by a University of Toronto student last year. It acts as a replacement for MARS as it operates as a sort of modern IDE for Assembly. 

As of now, Saturn lacks comprehensive documentation. It remains relatively unknown outside of the CSC258 student community. We believe that creating documentation for this innovative interpreter would not only benefit current users but also aid in increasing its visibility and accessibility.
