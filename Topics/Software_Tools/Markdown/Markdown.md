# Markdown Language and Documentation

## Introduction
Markdown is a simple, easy-to-use, text-based language that known for its readability. It is widely used in software engineering, mainly for documentation in open-source projects, README files, and text-filled files on web pages. Markdown is supported by a variety of different platforms, mainly GitHub, Reddit, Gitlabs, the popular Stack Overflow, and more! The purpose of this document, written in Markdown, is to give the reader a simple tutorial or crash course and detail its relevance and uses in the software engineering world.

## Tutorial
This section of the document will give a tutorial on the basic syntax for using Markdown.

### Headers
Headers are an integral part of writeups and documentation, providing context and organization within a document. The way to add a header to your document is to use the hashtag symbol, '#', before the text you want as the header. Headers come in a variety of different sizes, as outlined below.

The bigger the header, the lower the amount of #'s to include.  

### Line Breaks
Line breaks are an important part of write-ups. The way to implement line breaks in Markdown is to end a line with at least two spaces, and then hit enter/return and start typing on a new line. An example of the code, and its rendered output are in the below images. The code implementation is highlighted in blue to display the two+ spaces that leads to line breaks.

### Text Emphasis (Bold & Italics)    
#### Bold
To bold a word, phrase, or block of text, either surround it with two astericks (*) or two underscores (_) on each side. An example is displayed below.

To bold certain characters within a word, surround the characters with double astericks on each side. An example is displayed below.

#### Italics 
Italicizing text is done in similar fashion to bolding text. To italicize words or phases, surround the text with a single asterick (*) or underscore (_) on each side. To italicize certain characters within a word, surround the characters with a single asterick on each side. An example is shown below.  
<img width="182" alt="italicize1" src="https://github.com/learning-software-engineering/learning-software-engineering.github.io/assets/74106672/b4c369c8-cee5-4835-935c-d96db4f71d71">

#### Bold and Italics
To bolden and italicize text at the same time, surround the text with a pair of any of the following options displayed below, where the first two options are three astericks and three underscores. To bolden and italicize characters within a word, surround the characters with three astericks. An example is shown below.   
<img width="183" alt="both" src="https://github.com/learning-software-engineering/learning-software-engineering.github.io/assets/74106672/dd07d4a2-2cc7-4473-a913-3b8e0a9e4f6b">
<img width="142" alt="both2" src="https://github.com/learning-software-engineering/learning-software-engineering.github.io/assets/74106672/2f6c3381-9cd6-48dd-8dc0-134636decf38">


### Lists
To create ordered lists, number each item in the list with a number followed by a period. An example is shown below.   
<img width="87" alt="unordered1" src="https://github.com/learning-software-engineering/learning-software-engineering.github.io/assets/74106672/52b6b667-f1f4-4e93-a491-084c90b7bda0">
<img width="94" alt="unordered2" src="https://github.com/learning-software-engineering/learning-software-engineering.github.io/assets/74106672/2df3b800-4f76-48ea-9307-dcc65b0202d3">

Unordered lists can be done by constitently using either dashes, astericks, or plus signs before each item. Indented items can be done by hitting tab before using the dash, asterick, or plus sign.  

#### Nested Lists
Nested lists use the same concepts as creating lists and indenting items. To create a nested list within the list being created, simply add at least two spaces after the end of the list element the new list will be nested under.   
Then add four spaces from the position of the above list element before starting the new list element line with the symbol of your choice, numbers for ordered lists or astericks, dashes, etc. for unordered lists. An example is shown below.

### Paragraphs
To create paragraphs, simply use at least one blank line in between lines of text. An example is shown below.

There are many more features available in Markdown besides the few mentioned above. Markdown supports tables, text strikethrough, emojis, code-style blocks, just to name a few. To read more about Markdown in regards to syntax, or other inquiries, consult this link: https://www.markdownguide.org/

## Use with Documentation
Markdown is a vital tool used for documentation, an integral part of software engineering. The Markdown language can be used in README files, which are files with instructions on how to install, set up, and use the project, coupled with images, links and more. Markdown is also used in documentation within the project such as for API documentation, comments and descriptions written by developers, and more. Additionally, Markdown can be easily converted into different languages or formats such as PDF, HTML, and more.
