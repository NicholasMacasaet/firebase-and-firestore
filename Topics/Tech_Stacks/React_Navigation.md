## Introduction
An easy and efficient way to navigate between screens is important when we are trying to develop a mobile app. The library React Navigation not only resolves this problem but also provides a straightforward method allowing the passing of different parameters between screens. The easy way of communication between screens is one of the biggest advantages of React Navigation library. Thus, this page will walk you through an introduction od using the React Navigation library to navigate and to communicate.

React Navigation is a popular and widely used JavaScript library for building navigation and routing in React Native applications. Developed by the React Native community, React Navigation provides a flexible and extensible solution for managing the navigation and user flow within mobile apps.

The library offers a declarative API, allowing developers to define navigation structures in a clear and intuitive manner. React Navigation supports various navigation patterns, such as stack navigation, tab navigation, drawer navigation, and more. It seamlessly integrates with React Native components, enabling the creation of smooth and native-like navigation experiences.

With features like nested navigators, customizable transitions, and deep linking, React Navigation empowers developers to create sophisticated navigation systems that cater to the specific needs of their mobile applications. React Navigation simplifies the process of managing navigation, making it an essential tool for React Native developers.

## Installation
Minimum requirements for installation:
* react-native >= 0.63.0
* expo >= 41 (if you use Expo)
* typescript >= 4.1.0 (if you use TypeScript)

Install using npm:
```npm install @react-navigation/native
npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
npm install @react-navigation/native-stack
```

Install using Yarn:
```yarn add @react-navigation/native
yarn add react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
yarn add @react-navigation/native-stack
```

Install using pnpm:
```pnpm add @react-navigation/native
pnpm add react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
pnpm add @react-navigation/native-stack
```

## Navigation between Screens
### Step 1: Wrapping your app in NavigstionContainer
In your entry file (`index.js` or `App.js`), wrap the whole app in `NavigationContainer`.

`NavigationContainer` serves as the parent component responsible for managing all navigation-related matters. It's crucial to wrap the entire navigator structure with this component. 

For example:
```
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>{/* Your app code */}</NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Creating a native stack navigator
`createNativeStackNavigator` is a function containing 2 components: `Screen` and  `Navigator`.  All the pages that need to be navigated should be defined as `Screen`, and all the `Screen` should be children of `Navigator` to define the configuration for routes. Each `Screen` object takes a name prop which refers to the name of the route and a component prop which specifies the component to render for the route

For example in `App.js`:
```
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';

function Page() {
  return (
    <View></View>
  );
}

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Page">
        <Stack.Screen name="Page" component={Page} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}

export default App;
```
In the example above, the function Page defines a screen for our application. We have added this screen to our navigation stack in App() and we set the initial page when we open the app to this page.

### Step 3: Navigation
In step 2 we created a `Screen` component of Page. All the `Screen` component have a prop `navigation` automatically, and this prop have different functions which we could use to perform navigation actions. The function we will use for basic navigation is `navigate`. 

The `navigate` method is used to navigate to another screen given the screen name. 

For example we have two pages: page1 and page2, code below will navigate page1 to page2:

```
import { Button, View } from 'react-native';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';

function Page1({ navigation }) {
  return (
    <View>
      <Button
        title="Go to Page2"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Page2')}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

function Page2() {
  return (
    <View></View>
  );
}

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

function App() {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Page1">
        <Stack.Screen name="Page1" component={Page1} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Page2" component={Page2} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}

export default App;

```

`navigation` prop has another function `goBack`, which is used to go back to the previous page. To use it, we could just simply write
```navigation.goBack()```

There are more useful functions of `navigation` prop that could be used to perform different tasks. You can read about it more here: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-prop/

## Passing Parameters between Screens
Sometimes, we need to pass different values like ID or current status between screens when we navigate. 

We talked about `navigation.navigate` in the previous section. Actually, `navigation.navigate` can take two parameters:
```navigation.navigate(name, params)``` 
The parameter `name` refers to the page name we want to navigate to, and the parameter `params` refers to the information to pass to the destination route.

From the example above, if we want not only to navigate to page2, but also pass value to page2. We could write:
```
function Page1({ navigation }) {
  return (
    <View>
      <Button
        title="Go to Page2"
        onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Page2', {id: 1})}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```
We now have passed the id of 1 to page2, then we could access this value on page 2 by:
```
function Page2({ route, navigation }) {
  const {id} = route.params
  return (
    <View></View>
  );
}
```
Now we will have a new parameter `route` to Page2. `route` is like `navigation`, which is passed to all the `Screen component`. The value passed in is received and can be accessed in route.params in the destination page.


## Limitations
### Right-to-Left (RTL) Layout support
The library sometimes encounters problems with RTL layout, thus, it is suggested to use other navigation methods with RTL layout.
