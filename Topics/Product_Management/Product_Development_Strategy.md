# Why Create A Product Development Strategy?

When creating a new product as a product manager, the common stages involve organizing and overseeing cross functional teams through these stages of the product life cycle:

1. Identifying a product concept
2. Collecting data and feedback about the idea
3. Creating a MVP
4. Testing the product 
5. Launching the product 
6. Adjusting based on analytics 

A product development strategy is created by the product management team to be the step-by-step plans involved in propelling the product forward at each stage of its lifecycle. It also highlights the priorities, goals, and limitations of the project in order to set clear boundaries for the cross functional teams when questions arise. 

Creating an informed product development strategy is critical to the success of the product because it aligns cross-functional teams around a shared set of priorities and goals. This will help these teams make better informed decisions when unexpected situations arise. For example if there is a predefined PDS in place, then when users are confused with a minor feature during the collecting feedback stage of the product life cycle, the design team will know to put that on hold in order to focus on a bigger feature given the time outlined in the PDS.

# Steps to Build a Product Development Strategy

Product development strategies will vary based on a variety of factors such as the company, industry, and purpose of the product being built. However, there are common steps across these divides which contribute to the success of the product in the market. 

1. Conduct Market Research 
2. Conduct Primary Research
3. Build a Prototype And Test the Product 
4. Launch the Product

## 1. Conduct Market Research

An idea for a new feature or product may sound great in theory. However, to discover if there would be a real demand in the market, then effective market research must first be conducted to ensure true product-market fit. 

Common sources PM’s use include industry reports, statistics, and news articles, to find where their proposed new product may fit in the market. They then collect, aggregate, and form ideas from the data and put it in a centralized location to  decide on the direction of the product. 

With many possible directions that a product can take, it is important for a product manager to choose a prioritization framework to streamline the decision making process and pick the most suitable features of a product to work on. 

A **prioritization framework** is designed to help teams make informed decisions about choosing which opportunities to pursue based on preestablished business goals, product requirements, and constraints. 

A commonly used framework used in industry is the RICE framework. 

### RICE framework:
Developed by Intercom to improve its own internal company decision making efforts, the RICE framework allows PMs to score each initiative they may consider pursuing according to the four factors: 

**Reach:** Product managers first consider how many users their product will reach in a given time period. The terms ‘user’ and ‘time period’ can be defined differently based on the circumstances of the project. For example, users can refer to the number of free-trial signups or in app purchases made and the time period can be a month, a year, etc. 

The score will be the number of people you’ve estimated you will reach. If there were 1000 new signups in the course of a month, then the score is 1000.

**Impact:** The impact of a product can be both quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative measures can be how many people have bought the new product, while qualitative measures can be measured in a self defined scale such as perceived increase in customer satisfaction.

The original scale developed by Intercom was out of 3 (being the biggest impact) and with 0.25 (being the lowest) 

**Confidence:** So far, there can be a mixture of quantitative data to support the feasibility of a new product (such as with the Reach score) and scores where it is less data driven (such as the Impact score, when measuring customer satisfaction).  

The confidence score accounts for this and scales the overall project score by the team’s confidence in the viability of the project. 100% means high confidence, 80% means medium confidence, and 50% means low confidence. When the score is 50%, this usually means that the project has unrealistic objectives and can be put down in order to pursue other priorities. 

**Effort:** The effort score accounts for the potential downsides of pursuing this project. Calculating an effort score is done by estimating the time needed to complete the idea. This timeframe can again be self defined based on the constraints of the team.

## 2. Conduct Primary Research 

Market research is important in using existing data to gain valuable insights to the general market. However to better validate the viability of your product before any financial and personnel commitment, it is critical to conduct your own first hand research to fill in any gaps that the broader research may have missed. 

There are many tools which can be used including feedback surveys, first-hand customer interviews, user tests, and focus groups. 

Keep in mind when conducting primary source research that the questions should be simple and easy to answer in order to increase the response rate, and make consolidation and analysis of the data straightforward.

Some example questions that product managers have put on their feedback surveys and customer interviews are:

- How easy is this product to use? (1-10)
- Using this product helps me accomplish my goal (Agree/Disagree)
- What is your step by step process for using this product? 
- What do you dislike about the product?

Once this first hand data is collected from the target user segment, product managers then can use the feedback to create a product specification sheet. **Product specification** is the detailed breakdown of responsibilities and features that each team is working on. With the input from the data collections, product managers with their teams can now know what to build and create the logistical plans for its implementation. 

While creating the product specification sheet, it is important to also choose the right performance metrics so that the features worked on in the development process can align to increase them. These metrics are known as **KPIs** (key performance indicators) and they measure the success of the product during development and after launch. 

There are three categories of KPIs product managers keep track of: business performance KPIs, customer and user engagement KPIs, and product development KPIs. 

### Business performance KPIs help PMs track the profitability of a product. 
Some indicators to look at are:

**Gross revenue:** The total revenue created from product sales.

**Net revenue:** Deduct the operating expenses from the revenue and what is left is the net revenue. This indicator gives a clearer sense of the product’s sales performance.  

**Gross margin:** Is the amount of money retained after deducting the direct costs for producing the goods or services it sells. This indicator shows how efficient the production costs of a product are managed. 

```
Gross margin = (Revenue - Cost Of Goods Sold / Revenue) x 100
```

**Net profit margin:** The ratio of profit a product earns to the total revenue (net sales) the product generates expressed as a percentage. This is a key indicator of the profitability of a product. 

```
Net profit margin = Revenue - Cost / Revenue 
```

### Customer and user engagement KPIs help monitor user loyalty, satisfaction, and retention.
Some key KPIs in this category to monitor are:

**Conversion rate:** Is the percentage of users who undertake a desired action (such as purchasing the product, signing up for an account, or clicking on a video)

```
Conversion rate = (total conversions / total visitors) x 100
```

**Customer acquisition cost (CAC):** The cost acquiring a new customer. 

**Churn rate:** The percentage of customers who stop using the product. 

```
Churn rate = (Lost customers / Total customers at start of time period) x 100
```

### Product development KPIs measure the efficiency and efficacy of the development lifecycle.
These KPIs will help monitor that the development team is on track in an agile working environment. 

**Time to market:** The total time (measured in days, weeks, or months) it takes to launch a product from its ideation to its testing and its deployment. 

**Defect density:** The amount of bugs or issues in the product’s code divided by the total amount of code in the codebase. 

**Feature adoption rate:** How fast users adopt the product’s new features. 

```
Feature adoption rate = (Number of new feature users / Total number of feature users) x 100
```

Choosing which KPIs to track should align with the company’s broader business goals such as increasing profitability in the next quarter by 10%.

## 3. Build a Prototype And Test the Product 

Creating a prototype during product development is important in several respects:

- **Iterate better:**  The conventional method of creating a formal requirements document is a highly time consuming process. In order to give specific and detailed feedback, the person must study the document extensively to know where to request their changes. With prototypes however, if a change is required, the requester can directly point to the place in the UI where the change is requested. This allows product teams to make changes faster, and iterate better. 
- **Better technical feedback:** Developers often see the product late in the design process. If they can be shown a prototype of the product early on however, (instead of the usual lengthy documentation) they can easily see the dependencies between elements and suggest new solutions to help build the MVP. 

The **Minimum Viable Product** (MVP) is the simplest version of a product, and has the express purpose of having enough features to attract customers and validate a product idea. 

Testing the product allows the product team to see how customers may use or respond to the new capability and allows for the capture of errors before its launch. Standard industry approaches to product testing include A/B testing and QA testing. 

### A/B Testing

This form of testing is when two or more versions of the same product are created. They may vary slightly—the size of text in a website’s UI for example—or considerably such as different shapes for the device. This allows the product team to identify the best performing feature through learning about user preferences and needs.  

This is an effective form of testing because it allows for a direct comparison to be made between the single variation in the product, helping teams obtain accurate results about that specific variant. 

Running a A/B test involves the following steps:

1. **Determine the data to capture:** It is important to first determine what you want to measure, and whether it can be quantified such that the results will provide your team with insight into the hypothesis. 
2. **Prepare a Hypothesis:** Create a theory on how users will react to a feature of your product
3. **Build and Run the Experiment:** Create the variants of your product, and determine how long to conduct the test, as well as how much data to receive. It can be beneficial to use the predetermined KPIs as a measure of user performance. 
4. **Measure Results:** The results from the experiments can be used to make a decision about which features of the product to carry through on based on the highest performing variation.

### QA Testing
Quality assurance testing occurs usually in a simulated environment, where teams can imitate the actions of a user story to determine whether the product has any bugs or unintended effects. For example, a testing team may perform user actions on several different operating systems with variations on each system to ensure that the feature works as intended across all platforms.

Once testing is complete on the product, it is ready to be launched.

<a name="launch"></a>
## 4. Launch the Product 

Once the product is ready to be released, the final phase of the product development strategy is the launch. This involves the coordinated effort across multiple teams and departments including marketing, sales, and customer support in order to create excitement and make the product widely available. 

Key things to keep in mind for the launch are:

* Train the sales and customer support teams on the new product 
* Review the customer experience of buying the product, and make the experience smooth
* Review and modify the KPIs to measure the success of the product as needed
* Create a dashboard to keep track of the defined KPIs, to monitor the health of the product 

It it important to monitor KPIs once the product has been released to market in for several reasons:

- **Measures progress over time:** KPIs are quantifiable data which can be tracked in order to see whether your product is meeting your business goals over a period of time. By tracking the net profit margin, total revenue, and gross margin, businesses can track their financial growth and make changes accordingly. 

- **Make informed decisions:** KPIs allow your team to use data to make educated choices towards the product. For example, if your revenue decreased by 20%, you can look at subscription losses, churn rate, and conversion rate to make an informed hypothesis and make a solution based on that.

Products launched to the market may grow and decline and it is important to monitor quantifiable metrics through KPIs and continual user testing, in order to create better features, or eventually retire the product once it has declined. 

A product development strategy is essential to the toolkit of any product manager to develop new products and through this guide, the importance, steps, and implementation of a PDS can be created for future product managers or students seeking to create their own projects.
