## Resources for Task Management Software

# Importance of Task Management Software
Task management software is essential for organizations and individuals to improve their productivity, efficiency, and organization. With the increasing complexity of modern work environments, it is easy to get overwhelmed by multiple tasks and projects. Task management software provides a centralized platform to create, organize, and track tasks and projects. It allows individuals and teams to prioritize tasks, set deadlines, assign tasks to team members, and track progress in real-time. This software also helps in preventing the duplication of efforts and ensures that everyone is on the same page. Task management software also provides insights into the overall progress of projects, enabling teams to make informed decisions and adjust their strategies if necessary. In summary, task management software is crucial in helping individuals and teams manage their workload and achieve their goals effectively.

# Examples of Common Task Management Software:
<h2>Jira</h2>
Jira is a software development tool developed by Atlassian that allows teams to plan tasks, track issues, and manage their projects effectively. It is a popular tool used by agile teams to improve their collaboration, visibility, and productivity. With Jira, teams can create tasks, assign them to team members, and track their progress in real-time. Jira also provides features such as dashboards, agile boards, and customizable workflows that help teams stay organized and focused on their goals. In addition, Jira integrates with other software development tools such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and Confluence, making it a powerful tool for software development teams.

<h2>1. Getting Started with Jira</h2>
<p>Creating an account and setting up your first project:</p>
<p>1. Account Creation: Begin by creating a Jira account at the official Atlassian website (https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira?&aceid=&adposition=&adgroup=148251081967&campaign=19313278993&creative=660800633929&device=c&keyword=jira&matchtype=p&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p74602272796&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001558501&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAx_GqBhBQEiwAlDNAZvVBM7Ik2-ZOUzkNvA19dWoa_Iv3xSpZzckUgmmWfVwuZos1Qi5RThoCrFwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds#start-trial) and sign up for an account. There are various plans available, including a free tier, which makes the tool accessible for individuals and small teams.</p>
<p>2. Selecting the Right Instance: After registration, you’ll need to choose between either Jira Cloud or Jira Server. Jira Cloud is hosted on Atlassian’s servers, which provides seamless accessibility, while Jira Server allows for on-premise hosting, which offers more customization.</p>
<p>3. Creating Your First Project: Once you’ve logged in, begin your journey by creating a project. Projects are containers for issues and can be tailored to fit specific workflows. Jira provides templates based on the nature of your project, including software development, service management, work management, and project management.</p>
<p>4. Navigation: The Jira dashboard provides an overview of ongoing tasks, project progress, and important announcements. The dashboard layout is customizable according to your preferences.</p>

<h2>2. Core Features of Jira</h2>
<h3>a. Issue Tracking</h3>
<h4>Issue types:</h4>
<p>In Jira, issues are the core of project management. To effectively track and manage work, it is crucial to understand the various issue types that Jira offers. Each Jira product comes with default issue types to suit the needs of your projects and teams, such as:</p>
<p>1. Story: a feature or requirement from the user’s perspective, written in non-technical language so that anyone involved in the project can understand.</p>
<p>2. Task: work items that are not directly related to a user requirement but still must be completed, like the upgrading of a server or the implementation of a function.</p>
<p>3. Bug: a problem which impairs or prevents the functions of a product.</p>
<p>4. Subtask: the child of another issue, and is used to break down stories, tasks, or bugs into individually manageable pieces of work.</p>
<p>5. Epic: the parent issue that groups stories, tasks, and bugs to capture a large, holistic body of work</p>
<p>Aside from using the default suggested issue types, you can create and customize your issue types to match any method of project management you want. To learn more about the different issue types and their use cases, see this guide: https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/what-are-issue-types/ 
</p>

<h4>Workflows:</h4>
Workflows in Jira define the lifecycle of an issue, guiding it from creation to completion. Jira's flexibility allows users to customize workflows based on their project's unique requirements. A typical workflow includes stages like "To Do," "In Progress," "In Review," and "Done." Understanding how to tailor workflows empowers teams to align Jira with their specific development processes. By implementing a workflow, teams are required to follow a structured process, preventing the careless movement of tickets. 

The workflow stages will later create the columns of tickets on your board. Therefore, setting up the correct workflow and maintaining it is crucial to the health of your project.

<p>To create or modify workflows, navigate to the Jira settings and locate the Workflow section. From here, you can design custom workflows or modify existing ones to match your team's collaboration style.</p>

Best Practices:
* Tailor issue types and workflows to align with your project's needs.
* Leverage epics to manage and visualize larger bodies of work.
* Regularly review and optimize workflows based on team feedback.
<p>By mastering issue types and workflows, you'll unlock Jira's potential for streamlined project management and efficient collaboration.</p>

You can see a sample workflow for the CIY (Cook It Yourself) project with three teams, each following a different process. Notice how the "In Progress" column takes on three different forms depending on the team.
 ![Workflow](https://i.im.ge/2024/03/17/RPpLkp.Picture3.png)

Adadditionally it's important to note that custom workflows are one of many advantages Jira has over other tools such as Git Hub.

<h3>b. Agile boards</h3>
<h4>Setting up Agile boards</h4>
<p>Jira’s Agile boards are a dynamic feature for both Scrum and Kanban methodologies. To set up these boards, see below:</p>
<p>1. Create a new board and select your board type (either Scrum or Kanban).
  
    a. Scrum manages issues in sprints and best suits teams who deliver on a regular schedule.
    b. On the other hand, Kanban manages issues in a continuous flow and best suits teams to control work volume from a backlog.</p>
    
<p>2. Set up your board by configuring the board settings, such as the columns based on your workflow (e.g. To Do, In Progress, Done) and filters that determine which issues appear on the board.</p>

<p>For further details regarding board creation, see the below resources:</p>
<p>Tutorial: https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/creating-your-agile-board</p>
<p></p>Board: https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-is-a-jira-software-board/</p>
<p>Scrum Board: https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/create-a-board/</p>
<p>Kanban Board: https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/create-a-kanban-board-based-on-projects/</p>

<h5>Multiple and cross-project boards</h5>
Jira boards are very useful for keeping track of work and increasing visibility. However, managing a backlog, especially when each workflow column includes many tickets with different labels, can be challenging. Jira allows company-managed projects to use multiple boards to address this issue effectively.


You can utilize this feature to 
- Enhances visibility, especially when dealing with large volumes of tickets
- Allows each board to have its specific workflow for different teams

Keep in mind that setting up a workflow (as explained above), restricts moving tickets between columns. This ensures that everyone follows a process to complete their tickets. However, it can pose challenges when different teams have distinct needs in their processes. For example, a design team does not need code reviews and QAs. That is when multiple boards come in handy.

Below you can see two boards within the same project, one from a design team and one from a development team. Each board has its specific workflow tailored to the needs of the respective teams. You can take a look at the workflow section above to see each column and its connection.

# Examples of Modern Task Management Methodologies
<h2>Agile</h2>
<p>Agile is a task management methodology that is widely used in modern software development. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Agile methodology focuses on delivering software features in small increments, which are known as sprints or iterations. At the start of each sprint, the team identifies the tasks that need to be completed and assigns them to team members. The team then works together to complete the tasks within the sprint period. The detailed executions may differ in different teams and projects, but there are several key principles to follow:</p>
  <p>1.Prioritizing tasks based on customer value: Agile task management focuses on delivering the highest value features first, rather than trying to complete all tasks   at once.</p>
  <p>2.Collaboration and communication: Agile emphasizes close collaboration between team members, with frequent meetings and communication to ensure that everyone is on   the same page.</p>
  <p>3.Iterative development: Agile tasks are completed in small iterations(sprints), allowing for continuous feedback and improvement.</p>
  <p>4.Flexibility: Agile recognizes that requirements and priorities are subject to be changed, and allows for adjustments throughout the project.</p>
<p>The number of teams practicing agile in organizations has grown significantly in the past years, and agile knowledge has become a factor of consideration in recruiting processes. </p>

</p>
<h2>Waterfall</h2>
<p>
Waterfall is a traditional project management methodology that involves a linear, sequential approach to task management. In this approach, tasks are completed in a specific order, with each task depending on the completion of the previous task. While it is very useful for projects with well-defined requirements and a clear plan, it is much less flexible than Agile, and is also less popular in modern software development.</p>
